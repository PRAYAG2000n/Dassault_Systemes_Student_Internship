# Dassault Systèmes Student Internship – Electrical Theorems Simulation  
**Tools Used:** Dymola, Modelica  
**Duration:** June 2020 to Nov 2020  
**Internship Organization:** Dassault Systèmes  

## Overview

This project was completed during my student internship at Dassault Systèmes, where I was tasked with building and validating simulation models to demonstrate core circuit theory principles. Using **Modelica** in **Dymola**, I developed simulation environments and custom test scenarios for the following key electrical engineering concepts:

- **Superposition Theorem**
- **Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**
- **LC Circuit Driving Point Impedance**

I designed original questions, structured simulations, and validated theoretical predictions by analyzing current, voltage, and impedance characteristics across circuits.

## Project Components

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `superposition.mo` | Modelica file implementing the Superposition Theorem. |
| `superposition theorem documentation 2.docx` | Challenging questions created by the student based on superposition theorem post the experimental analysis |
| `MPTT.mo` | Modelica model used to demonstrate the Maximum Power Transfer Theorem. |
| `Maximum_power_transfer_theorem_1.docx` | Challenging questions created by the student based on maximum power transfer theorem post the experimental analysis. |
| `LC_Impedance.mo` | Modelica simulation of an LC circuit to observe frequency-dependent impedance. |
| `critical frequencies of LC impedance.docx` | Analytical breakdown of LC circuit behavior and critical frequency points. |
| `LC_DRIVING_POINT_IMPEDANCE.pptx` | Challenging questions created by the student based on LC impedance post the experimental analysis.. |
| `SPT and MPTT.pptx` | Slide deck providing a visual comparison of Superposition and Maximum Power Transfer Theorems with plots. |

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience in building physical circuit models using Dymola Modelica.
- Translated theoretical principles into simulation frameworks for validation and exploration.
- Strengthened understanding of multi-domain modeling and electrical behavior in frequency-variant systems.
- Practiced technical reporting and presentation of simulation-based results.

## How to Run the Models

1. Open Dymola and load the `.mo` files provided in the repository.
2. Run the simulation and view results via the built-in plot windows.
3. Refer to the documentation files (`.pptx`) for step-by-step explanations of each setup and observed results.
